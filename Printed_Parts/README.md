# Printed Parts

Here are the 3d printed parts necessary for a RailCore 2 printer. 

Some parts have been retired in favor of better alternatives from the community, and we recommend aluminum for the motor mounts, idler carriers, and X carriages; but the original designs still work and are archived here.

There are simplified DXFs in ../Aluminum that can be made through service businesses like sendcutsend, or they can be purchased from various vendors who carry RailCore parts and accessories.
