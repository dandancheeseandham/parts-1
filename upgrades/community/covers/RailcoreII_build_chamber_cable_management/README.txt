# Summary

This provides a cover over the wiring in the build chamber of the RailcoreII printer, as well as an updated cable clip based on [this clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2812010).  This keeps the cables nicely constrained and tidied up inside the build chamber.

The cable clip is a little beefier and matched to the housing's opening, and also provides a hole for the bowden tube.

FAQ: what's the small cable sleeve coming out toward the front of the printer?  I have my X-homing switch in the front right of the printer to shorten the cable length.

Future work: I'd like to modify the cable clip to work with a drag chain to the print head and also include a better fitting to hold the bowden tube in place securely.
