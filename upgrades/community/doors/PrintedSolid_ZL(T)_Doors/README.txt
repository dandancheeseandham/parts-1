# Summary

Here is everything I created for my Railcore build. There is the laser cut doors for both 300ZL and 300ZLT with a mount for the Duet PanelDue 5i. The side panels for 300ZL and 300ZLT with the cutouts for an Ultimaker Spool holder. Here is a link to the spool roller I'm using. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2974405 

I also remade the electronics enclosure corners to be much stronger, no supports and all heat inset screws for all connections. 

There is two versions of the panel spacer, a one piece and two separate pieces that is a little more shallow. I also made stl versions of the display spacer and display back if you don't want to laser cut it.
