# Summary

These are open-source doors for the Railcore 300ZL and Railcore 300ZLT.

You (hopefully obviously) need 2 copies of the appropriately sized door for your machine, 4 hinges (2 parts each!), and 2 door pulls.  The hinges are designed so that the side facing away from the machine (on both halves) should be printed up on the bed.

The hinges mount to the frame on the same bolts as the front panel, so you'll need to replace those bolts with longer ones.  They are designed to use the same longer hex bolts used in the build other places.

The "hinge pins" are M3 screws, screwed directly into the hinge body (2 per hinge).  Something in the range of 20-25mm in length will work.  You don't need a lot of engagement for this application.

The hinges attach to the door with (I think) M3x16mm bolts and nyloc nuts.  I used an M3 fender washer against the acrylic to spread the load of the screw out.

The door pulls each need 2 brass heatset inserts (same as BOM) and M3x8mm screws (again, with fender washers) to secure them to the doors.

When mounting the doors, assemble everything loosely then work on the door alignment while snugging everything up.  There is a little bit of play (and surely variation in parts) that you can work out to get everything perfectly aligned.
