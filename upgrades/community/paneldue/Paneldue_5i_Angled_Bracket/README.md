I printed the Paneldue enclosure linked in the RailCore II 300ZL Assembly Guide only to find out that the back panel also
linked there does not fit the 5i. I'm uploading a compact back panel that mounts to the railcore at 15 degrees. 
All parts are oriented and optimized for no supports. 

You will need for the 1515 extrusion:-
* 2x M3 x 8mm screws
* 2x M3 nuts 

You will need for back panel and enclosure assembly:-
* x4x M3 x 16 screws, 
* 3x M3 x 8 countersunk flat head screws
* 3x M3 nuts
